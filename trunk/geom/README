An object-oriented code for generating atomic structure
(struct.h5) files from an input nanostructure.xml file.

This is our initial opensource release, so we'll probably
get some things wrong. To make the project, try "make".
If that doesn't work, go into the src directory and
edit the Makefile. You'll need several libraries, including
NCSA's HDF5.

There are some example files in the examples subdirectory.

See the COPYING file for terms and conditions of use, 
modification, copying, and distribution.

See the INSTALL file for compiliation instructions.
