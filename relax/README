This program relaxes atomic nanostructures using empirical 
interatomic potentials such as Stillinger-Weber and 
Valence-Force-Field.

This is our initial opensource release, so we'll probably
get some things wrong. To make the project, try "make".
If that doesn't work, go into the src directory and
edit the Makefile. You'll need several libraries, including
NCSA's HDF5.

There are some example files in the examples subdirectory.

See the COPYING file for terms and conditions of use, 
modification, copying, and distribution.

See the INSTALL file for compiliation instructions.
