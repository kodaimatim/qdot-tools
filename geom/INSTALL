This is our initial open source release, so we'll probably
get some things wrong. We DO NOT have a configure script,
so you just have to look at our simple Makefiles.

To make the project, try "make".  If that doesn't work, 
go into the src directory and edit the Makefile. 
You'll need several libraries, including
NCSA's HDF5 (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/).

We've compiled and run this program on GNU/Linux, IRIX, 
and MocOSX.
