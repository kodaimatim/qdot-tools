This utility extracts effective mass approximation (EMA)
parameters from an atomistic nanostructure model. Input
is a relaxed atomic configuration file "relaxed.h5" with
stress tensors for each atom, and an XML input file,
ema.xml. Output is gridded data in HDF5 format.

This is our initial open source release, so we'll probably
get some things wrong. To make the project, try "make".
If that doesn't work, go into the src directory and
edit the Makefile. You'll need several libraries, including
NCSA's HDF5.

There are some example files in the examples subdirectory.

See the COPYING file for terms and conditions of use, 
modification, copying, and distribution.

See the INSTALL file for compiliation instructions.
